Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?
Branches prevent everything from being in one place, which can be problematic if 
someone makes a big mistake and all of a sudden everything gets affected. It also
allows multiple files to be edited at the same time which increases productivity.
Git also has a feature where you can go back and undo the push that you just did,
so if someone pushed something and it’s not good or it causes problems, someone can
just undo the push.
